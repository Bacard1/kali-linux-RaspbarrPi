The user will be created usinguseraddthe command. Then we will set the password with the passwd command. The -m command will create the userâ€™s home directory on kali. It will enable login with the user you created.
sudo useradd -m username // add -m new user

sudo passwd username // creating a password for the user we created
sudo useradd -m username // add -m new user


Adding to Sudo Group

In this section, we will add the user to the sudo group and finally change the default shell of the newly added user to bash.
sudo usermod -a -G sudo username

sudo chsh -s /bin/bash username
sudo usermod -a -G sudo username


Using The su Command
We can switch to the user we created using the su command.
 	
su username
