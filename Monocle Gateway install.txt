We have successfully installed and tested Monocle Gateway running on RaspberryPi OS (64-bit) BETA.
Please visit this page for ARM64 support on RaspberryPi.

Requirements & Prerequisites
Please review the following system prerequsites:

Monocle Gateway Prerequistes
Installation Instructions
Please follow the instructions below to install and setup your Monocle Gateway service.

Note: The following instructions are using the Debian installer package. If you would prefer to use a bash script installation method, please visit this page.

1.) Download latest Monocle Gateway

Download the latest Monocle Gateway build for your system here. Make sure to download the Debian installer package: *.deb > Monocle Gateway - Download Latest Release

This is a special build compiled specifically for compatibility across the Raspberry Pi 32-bit platform and various models.

 

Note: SHA1 and MD5 Hashes are available here

Or use the following command to download the latest Monocle Gateway build directly to your system:

curl -O https://files.monoclecam.com/monocle-gateway/raspberrypi/monocle-gateway-linux-raspi-v0.0.4.deb
2.) Create Configuration Directory.

Use the following command to create the monocle system configuration directory:

sudo mkdir /etc/monocle
3.) Monocle API token for Authentication

Generate and download your Monocle API token from your user account page in the Monocle web portal. See this topic for more details on how to generate your API token: Monocle API Token

Once you have downloaded your monocle API token file, move or copy it to the Monocle system configuration directory: /etc/monocle/monocle.token

4.) Install Monocle Gateway.

To install the Monocle Gateway service use the dpkg utility and the downloaded monocle-gateway-linux-raspi-v0.0.4.deb file by entering the following command:

sudo dpkg -i monocle-gateway-linux-raspi-v0.0.4.deb
The following is an example of the installation process.

5.) Confirm Monocle Gateway is Running

View the Monocle Gateway log to from command line to verify it's running and working properly. Make sure to look for any errors on startup that may indicate a problem that would prevent Monocle Gateway from working correctly.

monocle-gateway --tail
If Monocle Gateway starts up successfully and established a connection to the Monocle platform , then you will get a print out that looks similar to the following:

-------------------------------------------------
Look for the MONOCLE RTSP SERVICE - INITIALIZED message; this means that everything started successfully and the gateway is fully running.  

6.) Configure one or more cameras for use with the Monocle Gateway service.

The Monocle web portal has not yet been updated to include a user interface for configuring which cameras should use the Monocle Gateway service.

Please see the Tagging Cameras for Monocle Gateway topic for the interim solution.

7.) Test your configured cameras with the Monocle Gateway service.

Now you are ready to test our your camera(s) using your Alexa device and Monocle via the Monocle Gateway. Just ask Alexa to show you one of your named cameras that have been configured to use the Monocle Gateway service.

You should see the named camera displayed in the Monocle Gateway service command console followed by some details logging information as well as the camera stream displayed on your Alexa device.

Once you have successfully tested your cameras, you can exit the log tail by pressing CTRL-C (you may have to press it several times).

Service/Daemon Management
The following commands can be executed in start, stop and restart the Monocle Gateway service daemon. You must run the command with sudo privileges.

Start the Monocle Gateway service:

sudo monocle-gateway --start
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl start monocle-gateway
Stop the Monocle Gateway service:

sudo monocle-gateway --stop
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl stop monocle-gateway
Restart the Monocle Gateway service:

sudo monocle-gateway --restart
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl restart monocle-gateway
Get the Status of the Monocle Gateway service:

sudo monocle-gateway --status
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl status monocle-gateway
Enable the Monocle Gateway service on system boot:

sudo monocle-gateway --enable
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl enable monocle-gateway
Disable the Monocle Gateway service on system boot:

sudo monocle-gateway --disable
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo systemctl disable monocle-gateway
Logging
If running the Monocle Gateway as a systemd service the application will write its output to the journald service.

To monitor ("tail") the log file while the service is running you can use the following command:

sudo monocle-gateway --tail
Alternatively, you can also use the following native command:
sudo journalctl -f -u monocle-gateway
Removal Instructions
Uninstalling and removing the Monocle Gateway from the computer is very simple. You can use the dpkg utility to automate the remove of the Monocle Gateway service. This script will delete the executable binaries on the system, disable and remove the systemd service configuration and remove the monocle system user account.

sudo dpkg --remove monocle-gateway
Lastly you can optionally remove the monocle.token file, any custom monocle configuration files and monocle system configuration directory if you don't plan on re-using it in the future:

sudo rm -R /etc/monocle
