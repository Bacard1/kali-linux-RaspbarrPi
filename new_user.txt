cat /etc/passwd | grep oldusername

Replace the oldusername with the name of the user you want to use.

get_username_and_id in Kali Linux

This will display us a few details of the user along with the userid.

2. To change the Username. We use usermod command along with -l parameter in order to change the username of a particular user.

usermod -l newusername oldusername

Replace the oldusername with the name of the user you want to change and the newusername with the new name of the user.

change_username

This command will change the username of the oldusername to the newusername but will not change the files and userID of the user.

3. To change the UserID we use usermod command along with -u parameter in order to change the userid of a particular user.

usermod -u 1234 newusername

Replace the newusername with the username you want to change the id of. And Replace 1234 with the id you want to set for the user.
